Sample EMR project for using EMR with R

This is pretty simple, it uses hadoop streaming to launch R scripts 
for both the mapper and the reducer.  This sample uses a public dataset
and uses the r scripts provided at:

One perhaps useful thing that this project does is include a 
bootstrap script to update the version of R on the EMR nodes.  The 
script installs version 3.0 whereas the default version is 2.11.

Check the Makefile for the details, you will need to configure
s3cmd and the elastic-mapreduce commandline tools, then make sure
they are in the path, or set the path in the Makefile.

Then:

1.  make bootstrap - to create an s3 bucket and push the scripts and
	data to s3
2.  make create - to create a new emr cluster
3.  make submitjob - to submit a new hadoop streaming job to the cluster

the output will be in s3://<yourname>.r.emr/output/

4.  make destroy - to delete the s3 bucket and terminate the cluster
